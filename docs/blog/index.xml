      <description>INFJ  As an INFJ, I am naturally drawn to people who will open up to me.
For the most part, I love hearing about the intricate details of peoples&amp;rsquo; lives: their fears, their childhood, and their relationships. I enjoy the process of challenging people, and helping them self-actualise. Or, as my friends say, I am a ‘people-fixer’. INFJs are deeply emotional individuals, although they may not show it constantly.</description>

      <description>Tiny Beautiful Things - Cheryl Strayed Because we are all, in the private kingdom of our hearts, desperate for the company of a wise, true friend. Someone who isn’t embarrassed by our emotions, or her own, who recognizes that life is short and that all we have to offer, in the end, is love.
When I was done writing it, I understood that things happened just as they were meant to.</description>

      <description>Model - Mark Manson Emerson once wrote, &amp;ldquo;What you do speaks so loudly I cannot hear what you say.&amp;rdquo;
Your movement or lack of movement reflects and alters emotions, not the words. Words are the side-effect. Sex is the side-effect. The game is emotions, emotions through movement. If you learn anything from this book, let that be it.
As a man, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to actually be rich and famous, you just have to show a lot of potential for being rich and famous to be considered extremely attractive.</description>
