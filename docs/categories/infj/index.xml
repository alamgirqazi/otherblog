      <description>Tips for INFJ  Dear INFJ,
I know it&amp;rsquo;s difficult. Being in the world is very difficult. Existing is very difficult. I know you always look forward to running away from everything, from everyone, maybe from yourself. I know you are looking for something bigger, something beyond all what you know or everyone know. I know nothing will satisfy you in the dust and ashes of this world. So, dear, look for it.</description>
