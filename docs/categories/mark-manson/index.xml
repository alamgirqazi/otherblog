      <description>Models - Mark Manson Emerson once wrote, &amp;ldquo;What you do speaks so loudly I cannot hear what you say.&amp;rdquo;
 Your movement or lack of movement reflects and alters emotions, not the words. Words are the side-effect. Sex is the side-effect. The game is emotions, emotions through movement. If you learn anything from this book, let that be it.
As a man, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to actually be rich and famous, you just have to show a lot of potential for being rich and famous to be considered extremely attractive.</description>
