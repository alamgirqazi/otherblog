### Models - Mark Manson

Emerson once wrote, "What you do speaks so loudly I cannot hear what you say."

> Your movement or lack of movement reflects and alters emotions, not the words. Words are the side-effect. Sex is the side-effect. The game is emotions, emotions through movement. If you learn anything from this book, let that be it.

> As a man, you don't have to actually be rich and famous, you just have to show a lot of potential for being rich and famous to be considered extremely attractive.

> I put forth that women judge social status by behavior. Social status is determined by how you behave around other people, how other people behave around you, and how you treat yourself.

> These are the three tenants of being a high status and a highly attractive man: treat others well, be treated well by others, and treat yourself well. Later, we’ll see that these make up the Three Fundamentals that much of this book is based on.

> What they want is to be desired. They want to be desired to the point that a man loses complete self-control.

> It has slowly been discovered over the past five years or so within the pick up industry, that the more physical assertiveness you pursue a woman with, the more aroused she becomes -- sometimes even if she wasn’t interested in you to begin with. Your bold and aggressive pursuit of her often turns her on to the point where she comes around and wants to get to know you.

> How attractive a man is is inversely proportional to how needy he is. The more needy in his life, the less attractive and vice-versa.

> Here’s what I mean by neediness: being more invested in other people’s perceptions of you than your perception of yourself. Neediness plays out by people chronically investing themselves and their identities to receive validation from others around them.

> Women are generally only attracted to men who are less invested in them, than they are in themselves.

> By less I mean that as a man, you should only be willing to sacrifice your thoughts/ feelings/motivations for a woman less than she is willing to do the same for you.

> It’s important to lower one’s neediness by investing in himself rather than the woman he’s with. It’s the only long-term solution available to keep long-term relationships stable and happy.

> A rich man doesn’t need to tell people he’s rich. A confident man doesn’t need to tell people he’s confident. And a guy who "doesn’t give a fuck" doesn’t need to go around telling people he "doesn’t give a fuck."

> Confident people don’t date unconfident people and vice-versa. Women who aren’t needy don’t date men who are needy. They simply don’t have the patience nor the respect for them.

> Vulnerability makes perfect sense as an indicator to women of a male’s status and fitness.

> My belief is that women have been naturally selected to choose high status men based on their behavior first, and then their looks and accomplishments second -- as looks and accomplishments tend be reflected by high status behavior, not the other way around. This high status behavior is a man who is comfortable with his vulnerability, who isn’t afraid to express who he is, warts and all, to the world. This plays out in multiple arenas -- in the life decisions he makes (Part III), the extent of his courage (Part IV) and the way he communicates to others (Part V).

> As Psychologist Robert Glover says: "Humans are attracted to each other’s rough edges."

> It’s OK to say something stupid. Women will not dislike you for your rejections and mistakes or saying something stupid.

> They’ll like you for your ability to be OK with being rejected, to make mistakes, and to say something stupid.

> man who becomes comfortable with his vulnerability becomes the opposite of needy. If neediness is prioritizing others’ perceptions about you over your own, then vulnerability is the exact opposite. Being vulnerable forces you to accept and prioritize your own perception over those of others.

> As you make yourself vulnerable, you will experience rejection. And as you experience rejection, you will be forced to upgrade your own sense of self worth. There’s no other option. Slowly, but surely you’ll chisel a "Don’t Give a Fuck" attitude out of yourself that is genuine yet giving at the same time.

> The two aspects of female attraction. Women are attracted to men who are of higher status than themselves (or in our terms, less needy). They are also aroused by men who desire them.

> Women are tuned into a man’s overall behavior and demeanor -- not what he says, not how much is in his bank account -- but they look at what his behavior is and what it says about his level of neediness.

> Women want a strong, independent, high status male -- a "doesn’t take shit from anybody" bad boy -- but they want this bad boy to have a depth and a sensitivity that they only open up and show when they’re around her.

> How attractive you are is based your non-needy behavior. Your nonneedy behavior is based on how vulnerable you’re able to make yourself. And how vulnerable you’re able to make yourself is based on how honest you are to yourself and others.

> "The only thing that’s Capital-T True is that you get to decide how you see things."- David Foster Wallace,

> You can say the lamest and grossest (or funniest, depending on your perspective) thing to women, and if the sub-communication is, "I really don’t care if you laugh or run away horrified, but here’s who I am, take it or leave it," this sub-communicates a rock-bottom low level of neediness, and an incredibly high level of vulnerability.

> When a compliment comes from a man seeking nothing in return, it’s a gift of truth, a piece of his vulnerability and infinitely more powerful as a result.

> A woman’s desire is to be desired. But it has to be genuine desire. It can’t be a "I’ll desire you as long as you boost my ego and impress my friends" kind of desire.

> Man who feels like he needs to buy or steal a woman’s attention or affection through entertainment, money or superficiality is a man who is not confident in his identity and who is not genuinely attractive.A woman’s desire is to be desired. But it has to be genuine desire. It can’t be a "I’ll desire you as long as you boost my ego and impress my friends" kind of desire.

> It’s not about what’s being said, it’s about the intention and sub-communication behind it. When you’re willing to cut a woman off and tell her when she’s out of line, when you’re willing to tell a woman what you will and will not tolerate in your life, this subcommunicates the most powerful elements of attraction to her.

> If you make it clear from the beginning that you are unwilling to put up with games, then not only will the women you attract stop playing games, but you’ll stop attracting women who do.

> My honesty and complete willingness to be rejected (or to reject them) demonstrates my nonneediness and for the first time, makes them incredibly attracted to me.

> Men who are not needy establish strict boundaries because they value their own time and happiness more than receiving the attention from a woman.

> "Any individual who wants to be a leader has to be controversial. Otherwise they don’t stand for anything."- Richard M. Nixon

> You CANNOT be an attractive and lifechanging presence to some women without being a joke or an embarrassment to others. You simply can’t. You have to be controversial. You have to polarize. It’s the name of the game.

> You’d be surprised how many women will respond with attraction to nothing other than a man who is bold and willing to make a move.

> Remember women are turned on by men who desire them. They are also turned on by the behavior of high status. When you’re expressing your truth and showing shameless desire for her, you are demonstrating both of these qualities that turns her on.

> "I have failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed."- Michael Jordan, Athlete

> Show me someone who is successful at anything and I’ll show you someone who has been rejected and failed more than you can ever know.

> As with any failure, it’s not until you’ve been rejected a certain amount that you realize how insignificant it actually is.

> What stops the vast majority of men out there from going out and getting what they want (and deserve) in their love lives, is that they take rejection, failure and incompatibilities personally, as if it says something true about them.

> The only truth about you is what you decide about yourself. And the more truth you know about yourself, the more you’ll be unaffected by others’ reactions to you and the more attractive you’ll become.

> The Three Fundamentals are: Creating an attractive and appealing lifestyle; Overcoming your fears and anxiety around women, and mastering the expression of your emotions and communicating fluidly.

> “Man sacrifices his health in order to make money. Then he sacrifices his money to recuperate his health. And then he is so anxious about the future that he does not enjoy the present; the result being that he does not live in the present or the future; he lives as if he is never going to die, and then dies having never really lived.”- The Dalai Lama
