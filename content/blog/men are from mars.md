### Men Are From Mars, Women are from Venus - John Gray

the two biggest mistakes we make in relating to the opposite sex: men mistakenly offer solutions and invalidate feelings while women offer unsolicited advice and direction.

Men are motivated when they feel needed while women are motivated when they feel cherished.

Men primarily need a kind of love that is trusting, accepting, and appreciative. Women primarily need a kind of love that is caring, understanding, and respectful.

Love is magical, and it can last, if we remember our differences.

he most frequently expressed complaint women have about men is that men don’t listen.

She wants empathy, but he thinks she wants solutions.

A man’s sense of self is defined through his ability to achieve results.

Achieving goals is very important to a Martian because it is a way for him to prove his competence and thus feel good about himself. And for him to feel good about himself he must achieve these goals by himself.

To offer a man unsolicited advice is to presume that he doesn’t know what to do or that he can’t do it on his own.

women talk about problems to get close and not necessarily to get solutions.

To feel better Martians go to their caves to solve problems alone.

To feel better Venusians get together and openly talk about their problems.

When a man is stressed he will withdraw into the cave of his mind and focus on solving a problem.

By talking about all possible problems without focusing on problem solving she feels better. Through exploring her feelings in this process she gains a greater awareness of what is really bothering her, and then suddenly she is no longer so overwhelmed.

When women talk about problems, men usually resist. A man assumes she is talking with him about her problems because she is holding him responsible. The more problems, the more he feels blamed. He does not realize that she is talking to feel better. A man doesn’t know that she will appreciate it if he just listens.

Men are motivated and empowered when they feel needed…. Women are motivated and empowered when they feel cherished.

When a woman does not feel cherished in a relationship she gradually becomes compulsively responsible and exhausted from giving too much. On the other hand when she feels cared for and respected, she is fulfilled and has more to give as well.

men are primarily motivated by being needed, but are turned off by neediness.

I remember the story of a woman who complained that her partner would never make a commitment to marriage. To her it seemed that he did not care as much as she did. One day, however, she happened to say that she was so happy being with him. Even if they were poor, she would want to be with him. The next day he proposed. He needed the acceptance and encouragement that he was good enough for her, and then he could feel how much he cared.

Just as women are sensitive to feeling rejected when they don’t get the attention they need, men are sensitive to feeling that they have failed when a woman talks about problems.

Her unhappiness confirms his deepest fear: he is just not good enough.

It is difficult for a man to listen to a woman when she is unhappy or disappointed because he feels like a failure.

The number one complaint women have in relationships is: “I don’t feel heard.”
