## Tips for INFJ (5)

> If you are an INFJ, I’d like to congratulate you first of all, for falling into the category of the rarest of all types (<2%). Secondly, be prepared to read what I’m going to tell you-

> LIFE IS HARDEST FOR INFJs.

> Yes!

> Why?

> Let me frame an example.

> Do you see those long faced street vendors nobody buys anything from?

> Those senile men and women wistfully living lives, having been kicked out of their own homes by their own off springs?

> Those kids rummaging through the garbage bins, hoping to find stale leftovers, hoping to not have to sleep with empty stomachs?

> All of those people in pitiable conditions, in need of a helpful hand?

> INFJs care for them.

> Yes, we care for them.

> We, literally, have lost our sleeps thinking about others in need. But we are no superheroes. As much as we wish to help, we can’t and this pains us all the more. It was just an example to accentuate the empathetic side of an INFJ. Being INFJs, the sense of pity and kindness comes characteristically to us regardless of how much need we, ourselves, may be in. No wonder, INFJs are dubbed as THE UNICORNS-The rarest and the most precious beings.

> Coming to the actual answer, having experienced myself being an INFJ, I’d like the fellow members to ponder the following points as tips -

> Let go - You can’t control everything around you. People can be vile, cruel, cunning, avaricious, overly pessimistic and depressed. It is NOT your duty to help them all. Just because you are altruistic, kind and optimistic, it doesn’t make you responsible for saving others. Help those you can, WITHOUT HAVING TO DROWN YOURSELF.
> Stay away from pessimistic people - Although we are inherently optimistic, we are susceptible to fall in depression through the negative influence of others on us. CHASE THEM AWAY! Don’t let any kind of influence have a degrading effect on your otherwise charming personality.
> Educate yourself on INFJ DOORSLAM - This is actually true. It does exist. We have a tendency to permanently drive people away from our lives when felt exploited or unfairly used. This actually comes as a surprising part to our personality since we, as empaths, are expected to be givers and not haters. But INFJ DOORSLAM makes it sure to make an INFJ badass inside a sweetass. Realize this part of yours before you permanently lose a loved one who may inadvertently have broken your heart.
> Money is an essential part of life - I can attest to the fact that how much we, INFJs, despise the authority money has in our lives. We would rather pursue an artistic career that pays us peanuts than having to lose our creativity and become millionaires. We have a natural inclination toward art and beauty. Money does indeed hold little or no value. But then again, there is rent to pay, phone and electricity bills subtly crawl through the gap under the front door every month and not to forget, taxes! So, being financially secure should not be compromised. Pursue something that restores your creativity, at the same time pays you well.
> I assume, these points should suffice for now. Be a balanced INFJ and live life as it is meant to be lived.
