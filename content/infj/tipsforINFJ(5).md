## Tips for INFJ (4)

> When I think of some life tips for myself and those like me , I would think:

> Stop worrying. I’m always worrying about something. God damn it, there are so many things to worry about in life. Especially when you're an INFJ who tends to take on the problems of others, but don’t. The more you worry, the less you enjoy life, and the less you can work on the things that worry you. It’s hard, but try to relax, and most INFJs probably do already, but if not, keep a journal. It really helps in understanding and breaking down our inherent complexity.

> Not everyone can be like you. Expectations for INFJ are terrible, because our standards are so high, we are the only ones that can possibly honour them. Whenever anyone disappoints me (happens daily), my best friend would tell me, “Not everyone is perfect like you, Nadia.” and I guess, maybe the problem is that not everyone tries to be, or cares about their actions. So it’s really hard to understand, but people aren’t like us. We prioritise other people, and doing our best, which most other people don’t. This leads to a lot of disappointment, if we keep our expectations of others high. All INFJs struggle with temptation and not doing the right thing, and it’s not realistic to think that everyone else is strong enough to do it like we do.

> You can’t always be perfect in everything and that’s okay! I’m really perfectionistic and pedantic, and this has given me positive and negative things. It’s okay to what the best, or to do your best. But when your best isn’t enough, never yourself up for it. People can’t be the best at everything, and the only person expecting that of us, is ourselves. Don’t feel like your best is not enough, keep trying and appreciate your effort.

> Never give up hope, and never let the world harden you. Despite the fact that we are innately hopeful, there are still times that we are get really depressed. This is natural, but never let the world let you down. Being able to empathise with people the way that we do in this cruel world, is nothing short of phenomenal. We should consider ourselves so. We need to keep up the fight. It’s something that actually changes the world for the better. Martin luther king, Mother Teresa, Gandhi, Jesus (Isa), and so many others have had great visions and hard lives, but the world remembers them for that, and for going through with their vision. This is the ONLY thing that keeps the world going around.

> Please don’t be hard on yourself, INFJs. This fight is worth it. Everything comes when it is meant to, the only thing we can do is do our best to get. There is nothing overemotional/ childish/ over ambitious about you. The world needs people like you.
