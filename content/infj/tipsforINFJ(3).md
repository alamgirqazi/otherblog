## Tips for INFJ (3)

> Stay strong. Being an INFJ can be very difficult and stressful at times. There will be parts of your life where you feel extremely lonely or you think about all the regrets you have in life. These negative thoughts can hinder you and even pull you down a deep hole. You’ll have to remind yourself that you need to be strong not only for your friends and family but for yourself. As staying alive can be the hardest goal any human might have.
> Don’t do too much self reflecting. As INFJs tend to think a lot about what is going to happen in the future and what has happened in the past. This can probably run your brain to its grave.
> Never take out your anger on someone. It’s very rare for some INFJs to lash out at people but we are very emotional people who have a very strong sense of morals and beliefs that we cling on to for life. This is probably the one of the regrets I have personally, no matter how much you want to hurt the other person as equally as they have hurt you, taking your anger out on them isn’t going to relieve how you feel. I think it makes it worse sometimes.
> Do what you love. This applies especially when you are picking courses or occupations. As INFJ, you already have a lot of s*** happening around you so in my opinion you should pick something that you enjoy that will relieve you of your stress from pesky humans. However, make sure you can make a living out of it as well. Careers involving helping people or arts (painting, writing) always lure us.
> Don’t grow up too fast. I’m not sure if this is applicable to INFJs but since young, I always wanted to do things on my own and grow up faster. It’s better that you enjoy what is happening in your life right now while you still can before becoming an adult. There is a reason maturing sucks!
> Know that you are not alone. I’ve always thought that I was the only one that felt this way about issues and no one could see way it was wrong. Since young, I’ve always felt alone. It was only this year that I found out I was an INFJ, I saw that some of the INFJs felt the same way as I did. Just knowing that you are not alone can help.
